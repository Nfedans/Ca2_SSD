This is my Origami Instruction website. It is a PHP CRUD site.
### Instructions to run locally
* Create a MySQL database called SSD_DB
* Import the database from the "proper-data.txt" file into SSD_DB
* Go to the "database.php" file and change the username ansd password to your own - [View gist here](https://gist.github.com/Nfedans/4213471f90fad29209b14226ad26c13d)

* Then within the database, set creationID to Auto Increment for both tables



### Alternatively See app running [here](https://mysql06.comp.dkit.ie/D00238707/Ca2_SSD/)
