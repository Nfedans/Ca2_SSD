# Origami website
This is my Origami Instruction website. It is a PHP CRUD site.
### Instructions
* Create a MySQL database called php-crud in PHP MyAdmin
* Run the code in the sql-db.txt file in PHP MyAdmin
* Move the PHP files in to your htdocs folder so Apache can process the PHP code
* Configure the database.php file to connect to your SQL database
